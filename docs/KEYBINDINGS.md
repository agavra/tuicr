| `<leader>h` | Focus file list (left panel) |

## Review actions

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `r` | Toggle file reviewed |
| `R` | Toggle hunk reviewed |
| `c` | Add line comment (or file comment if not on a diff line) |
| `C` | Add file comment |
| `<leader>c` | Add review comment |
| `v` / `V` | Enter visual mode for range comments |
| `dd` | Delete comment at cursor |
| `i` | Edit comment at cursor (vim: text cursor at start) |
| `A` | Edit comment at cursor with text cursor at end (vim mode only) |

## Visual mode

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` / `k` | Extend selection down / up |
| `c` / `Enter` | Create comment for selected range |
| `Esc` / `v` / `V` | Cancel selection |

## Comment mode

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Tab` / `Shift-Tab` | Cycle comment type forward / backward (per `comment_types` order) |
| `Enter` / `Ctrl-Enter` / `Ctrl-s` | Save comment |
| `Shift-Enter` / `Ctrl-j` | Insert newline |
| `←` / `→` | Move cursor |
| `Ctrl-w` / `Alt-Backspace` / `Cmd-Backspace` | Delete word |
| `Ctrl-u` | Clear line |

With `comment_vim = true` the box uses [`edtui`](https://github.com/preiter93/edtui)
modal editing (Normal/Insert/Visual: `hjkl`, `w`/`b`/`e`, `dd`/`D`/`ciw`/`x`,
`u`/`Ctrl-r`, visual `v`+`y`/`d`/`p`). From Normal mode `:w` (or `Enter` twice)
saves and `:q` (or `Esc`/`q` twice) cancels — the first press arms the action
and the header shows a confirm hint. `Alt-Enter` (Option+Enter) accepts and
`Alt-Esc` discards directly (no double-press) — Alt is the one modified
`Enter`/`Esc` that reaches the app across terminals, including browser/web
terminals like zellij web. `Tab` cycles the comment type in Normal
mode and inserts `comment_tab_width` spaces (default 4) in Insert mode; `Ctrl-s`
also saves.

## Commands

In command mode,
`Tab` and `Shift-Tab` complete or cycle command names.

## Commit selection / review target selector

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|

## Inline commit selector

Shown at the top of the diff when reviewing multiple commits. Focus it with `<leader>k` or `Tab`.
When opening a GitHub PR or GitLab MR you have reviewed before, tuicr may preselect only commits
newer than your latest submitted review; commits already covered by that review are marked with
`✓`. Use `Space` / `Enter` here to expand or adjust the range.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` / `k` | Navigate commits |
| `Space` / `Enter` | Toggle commit selection (updates diff) |
| `(` / `)` | Cycle through individual commits |
| `Esc` | Return focus to diff |

## Confirm dialogs

|-----|--------|
| `y` / `Enter` | Yes |
| `n` / `Esc` | No |

## Mouse

Mouse support is on by default. Disable with `mouse = false` in config.

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Wheel up / down | Scroll the panel under the cursor (file list, comment navigator, diff, commit list, or help popup) without moving the cursor line |
| Click on a file | Jump to that file (lazygit-style) |
| Click on a directory | Expand or collapse it |
| Click on a diff line | Position the cursor on that line |
| Click on a commit | Toggle selection (or expand the row to load more) |
| Drag in diff | Highlight a range; press `y` to copy the selected source lines |

For full native terminal selection across the UI, hold your terminal's bypass modifier while dragging (usually **Shift** or **Option/Alt**, depending on the terminal).
